1 A piece of paper is 1mm thick. Assuming you can fold it as many
times as you want, how many folds would it take to exceed the
height of Mount Everest at 8,848 m?
Number 10%
2 The volume of water in a reservoir decreases at an exponential
rate, following v(t) = v(0)exp(-at) with a=0.1. How much time, t,
does it take for the volume to decrease to less than one half of its
initial volume, v(0)?
Number 10%
3 If you deposit $100 in a bank account that offers an annualized
interest rate of 5% (compounded annually), how much money will
you have (round to the $) after one, two, three, four and five years?

4 Suppose you want to buy a car worth $20,000. A financial

5 You are about to set up a new business and will invest $100,000.
On day one you expect to have 100 customers and the number of
customers will grow at a rate of 1% per day. If each customer
provides profits of $10, how many days will it take to repay your
initial investment based on cumulated profits? Plot cumulated
profits per day, show initial investment and mark breakeven day.

6 Using data from http://bit.ly/1JJyf29 and linear interpolation,
estimate the dates when the number of cases and deaths due to
Ebola exceeded 100, 500, 1000, 2000 and 5000. Graph the cases
and deaths (observations and interpolations) and mark the dates
when thresholds were exceeded with a circle.

7 Using data from 2014, downloaded in the previous question, what
is the average growth rate per day, as a percentage, in the number
of Ebola cases and deaths?

8 Using the same date, plot the number of deaths versus the number
of cases and estimate the average ratio of Ebola deaths to cases.

9 Obtain daily prices for two ETFs called ‘SPY’ and ‘TLT’ which
track the S&P500 index and long-term Treasury Bond. Select the
adjusted closing prices. Plot the two time series during 01/01/2014
– 08/31/2015 and make them comparable by starting from prices
of $100 on the first day in 01/01/2014 – 08/31/2015.

10 For the ETFs on the previous question, calculate daily returns, r(t)
= p(t)/p(t-1)-1, for each trading day in the same time period as
above. Calculate the average, min and max daily return for each of
the two ETFs during the time period and express these as
percentages.
